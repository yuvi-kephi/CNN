# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Abstract

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant microvascular complication resulting from diabetes. It's a growing concern, especially in the developing world. DR damages the retina and can lead to vision problems or even total blindness. This project introduces a computer-aided diagnosis system based on deep learning algorithms to automatically diagnose referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) by classifying color retinal fundus photos. The primary aim is to automatically classify the grade of non-proliferative diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy from any common retinal image.

## Introduction

Diabetic Retinopathy is a severe form of diabetes that damages the retina and can cause significant vision impairments. There are four stages: Mild DR, Moderate DR, Severe DR, and Proliferative DR. With the rise of glucose levels in the blood, DR can lead to vision loss. Proper and vigilant treatment can reduce the onset of new DR cases.

## Methodology

The proposed method involves the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image analysis-based detection of diabetic retinopathy. The convolutional layer processes the product between image patches and the channel. The activation function used is ReLU.


## Advantages

1. Accurate classification
2. Reduced complexity
3. High performance
4. Easy identification

## Applications

- Diagnostic processes, especially for infected patients.
- Use in Laboratories.
- Analysis of visual imagery.

## Conclusion

This project successfully classifies images of diabetic retinopathy using deep learning and machine learning. The dataset contains different types of DR images (Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferate) trained using CNN.

## Future Scope

The model can be further refined to classify various deficiencies, aiding early detection and treatment for diabetic retinopathy.
